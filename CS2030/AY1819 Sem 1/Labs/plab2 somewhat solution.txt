After input:
List<Student> students;
List<Integer> groups
List<Mark> marks;

Groups:
groups.toArray()

Students:
Loop through students, find mark in marks, print

Absentees:
students.stream().filter(x -> !(x.plab in marks))

Mark frequency:
(proper way is using collectors which is out of syllabus)
maxMark = marks.stream().mapToInt(m -> m.mark).max().getAsInt()
int[] freq = new int[maxMark];
loop through marks and increment freq accordingly
Loop through freq and print from first non-zero

Mark frequency per group:
for each group
	marks.stream()
	.filter(m -> get student from m.plab; s.group == group)
	.toArray()
	pass to mark frequency method
